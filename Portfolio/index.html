            <h1>About Me - Elam Olame Mugabo</h1>
            <p>Let me introduce myself, my name is Elam Olame Mugabo.</p>
            <p>I was born on December 31st in a certain year in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, in Central Africa.</p>
            <p>I have many passions such as sports, music, reading, video games, cars, shoes, science, real estate, stock market, cryptocurrency, and especially writing.</p>
            <p>I was born and raised in Kinshasa, where I attended kindergarten, primary, and secondary school. Then, in 2021, I moved to Ottawa, Canada, to pursue my university studies.</p>
            <p>I would describe myself as a serious person always in pursuit of self-improvement.</p>
            <p>My short and long-term goal is, and will always be, to be versatile by having knowledge in various aspects of life, with a particular emphasis on information.</p>
            <p>One of the biggest pillars of my life is my faith. Indeed, being a Christian, I attach great importance to it.</p>
